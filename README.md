PxyDrive: A Proxy Testing Framework
===================================

![Image](doc/figs/pixie-driver-100.png)

**PxyDrive** (pronounced _pixie drive_) provides a comprehensive testing
environment for web proxy programs.  It enables testing and
debugging of both the basic operations of a proxy, as well as its
ability to support concurrent requests and to provide caching of
retrieved files.  It is designed to help students implement a proxy
and to help graders perform automated testing.

Documentation is provided in the file `doc/user-manual.pdf`.

PxyDrive can be used to test any proxy program, but it is especially
designed for use by students, instructors, and graders with the Proxy
Lab associated with [_Computer Systems:  A Programmer's Perspective_](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu).

PxyDrive was created by [Randal E. Bryant](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bryant) of [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu)
in 2018.
